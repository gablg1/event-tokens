# Event Tokens

Crypto Tokens is a project created by Brex that aims to build long-term relationships with our customers, partners, and overall community. To accomplish this, Brex will airdrop crypto tokens to those who participate in future Brex events.

For each event, Brex will take a picture of something meaningful. This may be a picture of the attendees or something else that represents the event. This image will then be used to generate a non-fungible token (NFT), a type of crypto token that is unique and belongs only to you. This token will be fractionalized and distributed to event participants. Each fraction will serve as a ticket to join Brex's online community, enabling token holders to connect with others online. Furthermore, your token serves as a lifelong souvenir for previous Brex events you've attended.
